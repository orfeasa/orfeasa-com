## Intro

In this post I will try to describe my experience in facilitating the creation of the Annual Action Plan of the current board of [BEST](https://best.eu.org/), a 3000-strong student NGO.

BEST has local groups in 90+ universities in 30+ european countries, and also consists of an international structure with departments and projects, and a body that co-ordinates the work of the entire organization, the Board. The Board has a 1-year mandate and is a 7-person team that sets and executes the yearly strategy of the organization.

The strategy-setting takes place in the first days of the Board mandate in an event where the entire team is present. Usually they invite a facilitator to take care of the process, so that the entire team can focus on the content. The facilitator is usually someone who was in the Board in the past, has been certified by the internal training system as a trainer and has experience in planning and facilitating such events in the past.

So, during early July 2020 I was honored with an invitation to be the facilitator and I accepted the challenge!

## Why this event? 

So before getting started with preparation, I deemed important to understand and clarify what makes this event important. I saw two main aspects in this:

### Strategy for 2020-2021

BEST has a great tradition in formal processes, and this is reflected in the way the year is kick-started. Once the Board is elected by the local groups, the boardies undergo a board-to-board and an individual knowledge transfer, to ensure they are prepared to deal with the challenges their position faces. This is done in a level greater than any other place I have worked or any other team I was part of!

After the knowledge transfer, it's time to decide what to do for the year. Although the Board is the highest executive body in the organization, the yearly strategy has to be aligned with the 3-year plan that has been set and approved by the organization.

Once the Board sets the yearly strategy, in compliance with the 3-year plan, each department sets their strategy based on the one set by the Board. This is all done to achive alignment over time and throughout all the bodies of the organization.

### Building the Board as a team

The second goal of the event is to give a space to the team, where they can debate, cooperate and make decisions for the first time. As a facilitator, it's my job to create this space, make sure everyone participates and all voices are heard and handle any situations that do not enable the participants to feel they are part of a comfortable and no-judging environment. In general, building a team is a topic that I find fascinating, maybe it could end up being the main focus of another blog post.

## Preparation

After getting an idea of why we do the event, and what we want to accomplish, it's time to start preparing for it. One step at a time.

### Getting the participants' expectations

First thing, arrange call, this time 1 person missing, extra challenge

### Talk with those who know


### What's different this time?


### Read, read, read


### Visualize event outcome


### Make choices

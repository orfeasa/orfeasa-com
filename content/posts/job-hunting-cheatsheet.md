### Questions to ask

<https://github.com/Twipped/InterviewThis>

1. Genuine questions. These are the questions you actually want to know the answers to. These questions might be:
   - “How much of your day do you spend in meetings?
   - “How many people are on the team? What is the breakdown of different positions?”
   - “What are the biggest issues facing the team?”
   - “How does the decision process work? Who makes the final call? Who drives the decisions?”
1. Insightful questions. These questions show that you’ve thought deeply about the issues facing the team or company. Research you do in advance will come in handy here. For example:
   - “Office has been aggressively pursuing an online strategy. Is this a play at the consumer market to protect Microsoft from Google? Or is there a role in the business market as well, since that’s where Microsoft makes most of its money?”
   - “Why did Google opt to use an open protocol for this product? Is it mainly a PR move, or are there actually technology advantages? What sort of limitations is Google usually concerned with when leveraging open source?”
1. Passion questions. Passion questions are designed to show you as
   someone who is excited about technology, about the company, or
   about learning. These questions include:
   - “Though I don’t have a coding background, I love learning how software is implemented. As an employee, what sorts of resources are there to do this?”
   - “I’m not familiar with the technology you mentioned earlier. Could you tell me a bit about it?”
   - “Thinking back to people who have had this job in the past, what separates the successful person from the unsuccessful?”

## Offer Management and Negotiation

### Acceptance call

Sound excited

Ask for feedback on interview performance

And with something along the lines of:


```text
Yeah, [your company] sounds great!
I really thought this was a good fit, and I’m glad that you guys agree.
Right now I’m talking with a few other companies so I can’t speak to the specific details of the offer until I’m done with the process and get closer to making a decision.
But I’m sure we’ll be able to find a package that we’re both happy with, because I really would love to be a part of the team.

I’ll look over some of these details and discuss it with my girlfriend.
I’ll reach out to you if I have any questions.
Thanks so much for sharing the good news with me, and I’ll be in touch!
```

### Communicating offer to other companies

```text
Hello [PERSON],

I just wanted to update you on my own process. I’ve just received an offer from [COMPANY] which is quite strong. That said, I’m really excited about [YOUR AMAZING COMPANY] and really want to see if we can make it work. Since my timeline is now compressed, is there anything you can do to expedite the process?
```

### Offer negotiation

#### What you can negotiate

Dimensions:

- **salary**
- **signing bonus**
- **stock**
- **a year-end or performance bonus**
- **commuter benefits**
- relocation expenses
- **equipment**
- **an educational stipend**
- a childcare stipend
- **extra vacation time**
- **a later start date**
- getting a dedicated hour a day to work out or study or meditate or play solitaire.
- You could choose which team you’re assigned to, what your first project will be, what technologies you’ll be working with, and sometimes even choose your title.
- getting sponsored for conferences
- dedicated volunteer or learning time

Make sure you communicate your BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement):

- **staying at current job**
- interview with more companies
- other offers

#### Asking for more

```text
The offer you guys extended was strong. Right now my decision is basically between you and [staying at current company/other offer]. It’s a genuinely difficult decision for me, but there are a couple of dimensions where, if this offer improved, it would be much more compelling.

Specifically, [situation]. What can we do to improve the salary?

I know that you guys are looking for backend engineers to grow quickly and implement the major upcoming projects. I believe I bring experience and ideas and I’m confident that I’ll be able to help [Your company] in this endeavour!

Let me know your thoughts.

```

(alternately ~~stock options~~ or sign-in bonus)

```text
Choosing the company I’m going to spend the next few years at is a commitment I take really seriously, and so I want to be sure I’m making a well-considered decision.
```

#### Deadline

1. Be clear about your deadline.
2. Assert your deadline continually.
3. Use your final decision as your trump card.

Deadline should be a business day.

Trump card:

```text
Hi Joel, I’ve been thinking it over and it’s genuinely a really tough decision for me. I loved everyone at [COMPANY] but the one thing that makes it hard for me is the salary. As you know I’m trying to pay off my student loans so salary is really important to me right now. If you can improve the salary by 10K a year, then I’ll be totally ready to sign.
```

Hi <name>,

Okay, well, I’m sorry to hear that, but thank you very much for the opportunity. I really enjoyed the experience, and I hope to be able to revisit it down the road.
How long will it be until I can reinterview? Are there any particular weaknesses in my application that would be good to focus on in the meantime?

Thanks,

Hi <name>,

Thank you for taking the time to let me know. Software is something I am very passionate about and [Company] is a company I greatly admire. I truly believe the work you are doing will forever change the world for the better and I would love to be a part of it in any way.

If there are any future openings when my background and skillset would make sense, please keep me in mind. I would jump at the chance to be even a small part of this incredible organisation.

Hi, I'm Orfeas! 👋

I'm a Software Engineer living in London and working at [eCademy](https://ecademy.gr/), a new platform for businesses such as gyms and dance schools, that helps schedule and book classes, take care of payments and includes a [zoom](https://zoom.us/) integration!

🎓 I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [Aristotle University of Thessaloniki](https://www.auth.gr/en). This was a 5-year degree that awards a Master's in Engineering, and I graduated in the top 6% of my class.
While studying I was fascinated by the creative aspect of Software Development, while at the same time I enjoyed the more managerial mindset that I developed by being part of multiple NGOs and events.

🧲 My first full-time job was at [CERN](https://home.cern/) in Geneva, where I simulated a way to evaluate the way particles will travel in the next-generation linear collider [CLIC](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/compact-linear-collider).

🎯 After dipping my toe in a programming and sciencey role, I decided to switch gears and got elected as a member of the Board of [BEST](https://best.eu.org/), a student NGO of 3500 members in 32 countries. This meant a full year of managing the entire organisation along with my 6 fellow co-Boardies. This exposed me to the world of Project and People Management.

📈 Following those 2 experiences, I decided that I would like somehow to combine both worlds as an IT Project Manager, and I started working as one in [Procter & Gamble](https://pg.com/), in Bucharest. This experience taught me how big multinational corporations operate, how to handle big projects and how to communicate and manage expectations with senior stakeholders.

🤖 After working at P&G for a year, I realised I wanted to enter the startup world and I worked for [Geekbot](https://geekbot.com/), a standup bot for [Slack](https://slack.com/) as an Operations Manager, where I brought my expertise of how to organise a company more effectively and how to establish processes and policies. Being part of a startup, a team that is building a product felt right for me.

⚔ However, at this time I had to join the armed forces and serve for 8 months, as this is mandatory in my country. There, I was part of the Research and Informatics Corps and during this time I decided to switch to Software Engineering as my main focus.

👨‍💻 In my current job, I am focusing on implementing new features in our Python/Django codebase, to accommodate for the needs of our new clients.

🖍️ Outside of work, I enjoy delivering training sessions and facilitating workshops for volunteers at [BEST](https://best.eu.org/), and organising [DEVit](https://devitconf.org/), the leading web developer conference in South-East Europe.

Hi, I'm Orfeas! 👋

I'm a Software Engineer living in London. I like coding and working with people. I've worked in [Geekbot](https://geekbot.com/), [P&G](https://pg.com/), [BEST](https://best.eu.org/) and [CERN](https://home.cern/). I have experience in both Python/Django and Project Management.

🎓 I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [Aristotle University of Thessaloniki](https://www.auth.gr/en), a 5-year degree that awards a Master's in Engineering. I graduated in the top 6% of my class.

🧲 My first full-time job was at [CERN](https://home.cern/) in Geneva, where I simulated particle trajectories for the next-generation linear collider [CLIC](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/compact-linear-collider).

🎯 Shifting towards Project and People Management, I got elected as a member of the Board of [BEST](https://best.eu.org/), managing a student NGO of 3500 members in 32 countries.

📈 I then started working as an IT Project Manager in [Procter & Gamble](https://pg.com/), in Bucharest. This experience taught me how big multinational corporations operate, how to handle big projects and how to communicate and manage expectations with senior stakeholders.

🤖 After working at P&G for a year, I realised I wanted to enter the startup world and I worked for [Geekbot](https://geekbot.com/), a standup bot for [Slack](https://slack.com/) as an Operations Manager, where I brought my expertise of how to organise a company more effectively and how to establish processes and policies. Being part of a startup, a team that is building a product felt right for me.

⚔ However, at this time I had to join the armed forces and serve for 8 months, which is mandatory in my country. There, I was part of the Research and Informatics Corps and during this time I decided to switch to Software Engineering as my main focus.

📅 After that I worked at [eCademy](https://ecademy.gr/), helping businesses adapt to Covid-19 and moving their operations online. I implemented new features in Python/Django to accommodate the needs of new clients.

🔭 Currently, I'm working at [Thought Machine](https://thoughtmachine.net/) as a Backend Engineer, on our cloud-native core banking platform.

🖍️ Outside of work, I enjoy delivering training sessions at [BEST](https://best.eu.org/), organising [DEVit](https://devitconf.org/), the leading web developer conference in South-East Europe and I'm also the co-host of the [Passion(s) Unraveled](https://www.passionsunraveled.com) podcast.

Hi, I'm Orfeas! 👋

I'm an Engineering Manager at [Thought Machine](https://thoughtmachine.net/) in London, where I lead a team responsible for core banking services in Vault Core. My background is in backend and distributed systems, with hands-on experience in Go, Python, and gRPC microservices. I enjoy taking messy, ambiguous problems and turning them into clear milestones, predictable delivery, and better operational readiness.

### What I Do

- I lead an engineering team responsible for a core banking service area in Vault Core.
- I own delivery for client commitments: planning, prioritisation, sequencing, and risk management.
- I work closely with Product and stakeholders to turn requirements into milestones and decisions.
- I improve service health through reliability work, observability, runbooks, and incident learning.
- I coach engineers through 1:1s, feedback, and clear standards, while spreading technical ownership across the team.

### How I Work

I care about three things: delivery, reliability, and engineering growth. I try to keep scope clear, make trade-offs explicit, and set a rhythm that helps the team ship confidently. I prefer lightweight process, clear expectations, and practical feedback so standards go up without slowing people down.

### Background

Before moving into engineering management, I worked as a backend engineer on APIs and distributed systems. I've worked in both large companies and startups, including [Procter & Gamble](https://pg.com/), [Geekbot](https://geekbot.com/), and [CERN](https://home.cern/).

🎓 I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [Aristotle University of Thessaloniki](https://www.auth.gr/en), a 5-year degree that awards a Master's in Engineering.

🖍️ Outside of work, I enjoy delivering training sessions at [BEST](https://best.eu.org/) and organising [DEVit](https://devitconf.org/).

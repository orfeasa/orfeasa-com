Hi, I'm Orfeas! 👋

Orfeas Antoniou is an Engineering Manager at [Thought Machine](https://thoughtmachine.net/) in London, leading a team responsible for core banking services within Vault Core. He specialises in backend systems and distributed services, with a background in Go and gRPC microservices. Orfeas focuses on turning ambiguous problems into clear milestones, keeping delivery predictable, and improving operational readiness through strong engineering standards and pragmatic coaching.

### What I Do

- Lead an engineering team responsible for a core banking service area in Vault Core.
- Own delivery for client commitments: planning, prioritisation, sequencing, and risk management.
- Partner closely with Product and stakeholders to turn requirements into milestones and decisions.
- Improve service health: reliability, observability, runbooks, and incident learning.
- Coach engineers through 1:1s, feedback, and clear standards, while distributing technical ownership across the team.

### How I Work

My work sits at the intersection of delivery, reliability, and engineering growth: shaping execution rhythms, keeping scope tight, and making trade-offs explicit so teams can ship with confidence. I focus on operational excellence and sustainable delivery, raising standards through clear expectations, useful feedback, and lightweight process that helps engineers move faster without becoming a bottleneck.

### Background

I have a backend engineering background in Go and Python, with experience designing APIs and scaling distributed systems. Previously, I have worked in environments ranging from large enterprises to startups, including [Procter & Gamble](https://pg.com/), [Geekbot](https://geekbot.com/), and [CERN](https://home.cern/).

🎓 I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [Aristotle University of Thessaloniki](https://www.auth.gr/en), a 5-year degree that awards a Master's in Engineering.

🖍️ Outside of work, I enjoy delivering training sessions at [BEST](https://best.eu.org/) and organising [DEVit](https://devitconf.org/).
